## Definition of Done (DoD)
A task is considered done only when:
- The code is functional and tested.  
- Committed to GitHub.  
- Documented clearly.  
- Marked as completed in Taiga.

For features, this means:
- The tool correctly loads, cleans, and summarizes the dataset.  
- Outputs are accurate and error-free.
